# Assignment5-Dynamics

In this directory, Euler-Lagrange dynamic model has been implemented for RR plananr manipulator using moving frames algorithm (Direct and Inverse Dynamics) and Newton-Euler dynamic model for inverse problem using recursive algorithm.

## How to use?

1. To print the report for the stored calibration data, run main.py:
   ```bash
      python3 main.py
   ```

2. To run the calibration, run calibrate.py:
   ```bash
      python3 calibrate.py
   ```
