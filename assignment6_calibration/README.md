# Assignmen6-Calibration

In this directory, a calibration for a 6-DoF Fanuc manipulator (FANUC_R_2000i) is being done by algorithms from the following literatures:


* Wu, Y. Optimal pose selection for the identification of geometric and elastostatic parameters of machining robots. PhD thesis, 2014.
* Wu, Y., Klimchik, A., Caro, S., Furet, B., and Pashkevich, A.
Geometric calibration of industrial robots using enhanced partial pose measurements and design of experiments. Robotics and Computer-Integrated
Manufacturing 35 (2015), 151â€“168.

## How to use?

1. To print the report for the stored calibration data, run main.py:
   ```bash
      python3 main.py
   ```

2. To run the calibration, run calibrate.py:
   ```bash
      python3 calibrate.py
   ```
